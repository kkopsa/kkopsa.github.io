	<p>
		In January 2012, I started my career as a software developer when I took
		my first programming class at BYU-Idaho. I realized quickly that I liked 
		high-level programming languages.
	<p>	
		Since then, I have grown to love programming and software development
		even more.
	<p>	
		Throughout my education, I have had the opportunity to hone my skills in various capacities.
		I worked in software quality assurance as a tester for 
		Surge&trade;, a custom
		software development and consulting company. I gained experience in 
		software development methodology as well as technical knowledge of
		testing web and mobile applications.
	<p>	
		Afterwards I continued my education for a few more semesters and later
		became a mobile application developer for the same company I previously worked at. 
		I gained experience with both Android and iOS mobile platforms.
	<p>
		I worked as a web developer at FamilySearch. I developed web applications using Java,
		AngularJS, PostgresQL, Hibernate, Maven, and various other technologies along the way.	
	<p>
		I am passionate about mobile and web technologies and applications and the potential they have 
		to do good throughout the world.
		I love the idea of
		helping everyone, especially developing countries utilize this technology that has
		been placed in the hands of billions around the globe.
	<p>	
		It is my dream to further mobile and web technologies as a means to help developing
		countries throughout the world.
