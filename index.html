		<p>
			In January 2012, I started my career as a software developer when I took
			my first programming class at BYU-Idaho. I realized quickly that I liked 
			high-level programming languages.
		<p>	
			Since then, I have grown to love programming and software development
			even more.
		<p>	
			Throughout my education, I have had the opportunity to hone my skills in various capacities.
			I worked in software quality assurance as a tester for 
			Surge&trade;, a custom
			software development and consulting company. I gained experience in 
			software development methodology as well as technical knowledge of
			testing web and mobile applications.
		<p>	
			Afterwards I continued my education for a few more semesters and later
			became a mobile application developer for the same company I previously worked at. 
			I gained experience with both Android and iOS mobile platforms.
		<p>
			I worked as a web developer at FamilySearch. I developed web applications using Java,
			AngularJS, PostgresQL, Hibernate, Maven, and various other technologies along the way.	
		<p>
			I am passionate about mobile and web technologies and applications and the potential they have 
			to do good throughout the world.
			I love the idea of
			helping everyone, especially developing countries utilize this technology that has
			been placed in the hands of billions around the globe.
		<p>	
			It is my dream to further mobile and web technologies as a means to help developing
			countries throughout the world.
